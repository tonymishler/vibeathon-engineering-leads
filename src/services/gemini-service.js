Analyze this list of Slack channels and categorize them based on the following criteria:

1. Priority Channels (return these first):
   - Channels starting with "client-" or "eb-"
   - Channels that appear to be about specific clients or engineering projects

2. Standard Channels (return these second):
   - General work-related channels
   - Team channels
   - Project channels not matching priority criteria

3. Exclude (do not return):
   - Channels containing "off-topic"
   - Social or non-work channels
   - General chat or random channels

For each channel, determine its category based on its name, topic, and purpose.
Return the results as a JSON object with two arrays: "priority_channels" and "standard_channels".
Each channel in these arrays should keep its original properties and add a "reason" field explaining why it was categorized this way.

4. Performance or scaling challenges
5. User experience issues that could be improved
